## Installation

The recommended way to use this Stripe Sample is with the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install):

```sh
stripe samples create accept-a-payment
```

You can also clone the repository, but there is a bit more manual setup work to
configure the `.env` environment variable file in the server directory.

You'll find more detailed instructions for each integration type in the
relevant READMEs:

- [Prebuilt Checkout page](./prebuilt-checkout-page/README.md)
- [Custom payment flow](./prebuilt-checkout-page/README.md)

## FAQ

Q: Why did you pick these frameworks?

A: We chose the most minimal framework to convey the key Stripe calls and
concepts you need to understand. These demos are meant as an educational tool
that helps you roadmap how to integrate Stripe within your own system
independent of the framework.
